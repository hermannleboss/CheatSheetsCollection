[The art of command line](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line#readme) is a complete pro-maker for beginners.
It serves as a open source repository. This also has a lot of protips!

The online book [Learn Enough Command Line to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial) is a great
resource for mastering the command line. Chapter 1 is free and provides a good introduction to command line tools. The
rest of the book is not free and goes into more depth than you really need at this point, but feel free to purchase and read the rest of the book if you like.

[ExplainShell.com](http://explainshell.com/) is a great resource for if you want to deconstruct a particularly strange shell command or learn how Bash
works through guess-and-check.

[Unix/Linux Command Cheat Sheet](https://files.fosswire.com/2007/08/fwunixref.pdf) contains a list of important commands that you can refer to regularly as you become familiar
with using Linux. You can print it out so you can have a physical copy with you when you’re not at your computer.

[Video Series from LearnLinuxTv](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKHaKA9-4_I38sLzK134p4GJ) contains 24 videos explaining the basics of the command line. Videos are brief enough for
beginners but, at the same time, are detailed enough to get started and light your inner curiosity.
